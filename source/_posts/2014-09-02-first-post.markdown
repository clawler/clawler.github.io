First blog posts are always so awkward.

This octopress thing is going to *force* me to use markdown so the rest of this
post is going to be pretty contrived.

This is a [test link to my personal website](http://www.caseylawler.com).
You'll note that this should link directly back here.

### Here is one of my favorite quotes by [Miranda July](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/65678.Miranda_July):

> What a terrible mistake to let go of something wonderful for something real.

Hopefully this page will render properly so I can get to writing about things
that actually mean something to me.

Stay tuned!
